## Introduction

This project aims to program a Kawasaki Robotic Arm using a video camera. ***How do you do that?*** Keep reading to find out.

Basically, the repository contains code to do the following:

- Extracts coordinates from a video and prints them into a file.
- Transforms the previous data into AS language.
- Loads the resulting file into a MongoDB collection.
- Downloads the code into the computer connected to the robot and sends the instructions.
